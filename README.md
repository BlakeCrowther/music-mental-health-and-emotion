# Music, Mental Health, and Emotion

### Overview

This project investigates how individuals' self-reported music preferences correlate with their mental health indicators, and if emotional trends in the Emotion Labeled Spotify Songs Dataset provide additional insights into these relationships.

### Datasets & EDA

To explore this inquiry I analyze and relate data from the [Music & Mental Health Survey Results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results) dataset and the Moodify, or [278k Emotion Labeled Spotify Songs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdullahorzan/moodify-dataset) dataset. Copies of the raw datasets can be found in the `data` folder. More information and initial EDA for the datasets can be found in the [mxmh_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/BlakeCrowther/music-mental-health-and-emotion/blob/main/notebooks/mxmh_EDA.ipynb) and [moodify_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/BlakeCrowther/music-mental-health-and-emotion/blob/main/notebooks/moodify_EDA.ipynb) notebooks respectively.

### Results

The research into relating these dataset can be found in the [results.ipynb](https://github.com/BlakeCrowther/music-mental-health-and-emotion/blob/main/notebooks/results.ipynb).
